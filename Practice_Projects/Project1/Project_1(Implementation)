1. Setting up (main)
    Start with getting webcam information and setting frame size/luminosity
    Read the webcam information into two variables (success, image)
    Create an editable copy of the image (to draw on and show)
    Update the image frame every millisecond (while loop + waitKey(1))

2. Reading Colour 
    Create Trackbars for min and max hue, saturation, and value
    Convert initial image from BGR to HSV and pass to function
    Use GaussianBlur and Contouring to get object outline 
    Adjust HSV values till only coloured area is displayed on copyImage
    Make a global array for adjusted HSV values for given colours

3. Drawing colours
    Modify the contouring function to return x and y value of tip of shape (bounding rect)
    Save the x and y values in an array pertaining to the colour 
    Modify copy to have the array of colours drawn:
        array[colourNum][n] to array[colourNum][n+1] loop if line
        array[colourNum[n] loop if circles
    return the copy


Possible improvements
    Use boxPoints function instead of just bounding to account for turning the shape
    Add more colours to the range (possible function to ignore background? or determine colour drawn)
